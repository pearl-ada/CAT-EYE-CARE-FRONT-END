       <p> After cataract surgery, light exercises like walking, gentle stretching, cycling, running, golf, and
     tennis can be done within a week. Moderate activities like brisk walking, jogging, yoga, and
      dancing are suitable after 2 weeks, while more intense exercises such as weightlifting, running, swimming, 
         and intense cycling can be resumed around 4 to 6 weeks post-surgery.</p>
